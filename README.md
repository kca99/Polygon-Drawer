CMPT 361 Assignment 3:

NOTE TO READER:
Remember to set working directory (for QT) to this directory else the simpfile parser won't work!

Simpfiles: place all simpfiles in the same directory as the other files. To open/parse these, call one them using the readsimp(file) function where file is the name of the file in quotations.
